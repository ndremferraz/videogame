# Video Game Project (Work in ProgressðŸš¥)
## The purpose of this repository is to document my process of creating a handheld video game console. My intention with this project is to practice some skills realted to embedded software and electronics while I do something fun.
### The Project used a Raspberry Pi Pico to connect to control a OLED screen equiped with a SSD1306 chip, inputs were read from the a Joystick and 4 different buttons.
### In this Project I not only wrote the code using the C/C++ SDK but also designed a PCB for the Circuit. 
### The Code can be found under the videogame subfolder and Schematics and PCB found under PacmanProject(Which was the original Idea)
