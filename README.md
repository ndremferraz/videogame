# Video Game Project (V1 finished)
The purpose of this repository is to document my process of creating a handheld video game console. My intention with this project is to practice some skills realted to embedded software and electronics while I do something fun.

The Project used a Raspberry Pi Pico to connect to control a OLED screen equiped with a SSD1306 chip using I2C protocol, inputs were read from the a Joystick and 4 different buttons.

In this Project I not only wrote the code using the C/C++ SDK but also designed a PCB for the Circuit. 

The Code can be found under the videogame subfolder and Schematics and PCB found under PacmanProject(Which was the original Idea)

For the creating of the ssd1306.c file I did base myself on the ssd1306 example provided by the raspberry pi foundation, the rest is all mine.
